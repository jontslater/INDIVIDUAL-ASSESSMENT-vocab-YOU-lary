Description of the user and the problem you are solving for them: This app will function as a quick reference for students to review tech terms and definition, sort by terms and definition, and add any new terms they would like to revisit.
Example 1: As a developer, it is important to understand the concepts of Array Methods. In this repo, I have code samples that show how I have worked through learning Array Methods
Example 2: The user for my application is a working mother who wants to keep track of everyone's schedules. Normal ToDo lists are for single users. This application was created to allow multiple users to create, read, update, and delete items on a single list
